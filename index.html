<h2>About me:</h2>
I am a first-year master's student studying Computer Science. I received a B.S. in Computer Science from UCSC in June 2022. My research interests are in operating systems, storage systems, cloud computing, data analytics, computer security, and computer networking.

<h2>Projects:</h2>
<h3>Jakes’s Hockey Pool</h3>
Jake’s Hockey Pool is a private, hockey-themed fantasy sports website
<br>
Website: https://github.com/melliott18/jakes-hockey-pool
<ul>
<li>Wrote a live data feed interface and built a map to the undocumented NHL REST API</li>
<li>Contributed to the data structure and schema designs of the pool and called for architecture review and design specs</li>
<li>Employed a modular approach to the code design to simplify and speed up development and testing</li>
<li>Wrote the code in Python and used MySQL to manage the database</li>
</ul>
<h3>Multithreaded RPC Server</h3>
<ul>
<li>Implemented a multithreaded remote procedure call (RPC) server to perform arithmetic operations and file services in C</li>
<li>Client requests and server responses were sent in network byte order using a user-defined protocol</li>
<li>Server was scalable and supported recursive name resolution for variables, persistent key-value pairs, and fault tolerance</li>
</ul>
<h3>Deduplicating Key-Value Store </h3>
<ul>
<li>Designed and built a deduplicating key-value store file system for FreeBSD implemented as a userspace program in C</li>
<li>File system mapped 160-bit keys to unique 4 KiB blocks stored in a mounted memory disk</li>
<li>Memory disk was formatted with a superblock to store the file system metadata and inodes to contain the mappings to data blocks</li>
</ul>
<h3>In-Memory File System</h3>
<ul>
<li>Built a Unix-style in-memory filesystem with a tree structure hierarchy in C++</li>
<li>Program was simulated in a terminal shell environment with support for commands such as cat, cd, ls, make, mkdir, pwd, and rm</li>
<li>Shell commands modified an inode tree consisting of a root node and mappings to files and directories</li>
</ul>
<h3>Multithreaded Password Cracker</h3>
<ul>
<li>Created a truly parallel multithreaded password cracker in C++ that spanned across multiple servers on independent computers</li>
<li>Utilized every CPU core available by assigning each thread a separate section of the password keyspace to crack</li>
<li>Threads that cracked passwords would communicate to the other servers by multicasting over the network</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hobbies/Interests:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Hockey</li>
<li>Exercising</li>
<li>Biking</li>
<li>Hiking</li>
</ul>
